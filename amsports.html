"AM Sports provided Hart football with a great service to our alumni, boosters, fans and community. The live and archived broadcasts and production were excellent. Very easy access. We even used the audio broadcast with our video to make a highlight film for the end of the season. The response to the football broadcasts was outstanding. Al and Mark were great to work with and were complete professionals. I definitely would recommend AM Sports to any high school or college athletic program planning to broadcast their games."<br /> Mike Herrington - Newhall Hart HS/Head Football Coach<br /><br /> "This past football season, Upland high school teamed with AlanMark Sports Productions to broadcast our football games on the internet.  It was excellent! It created a sense of excitement and interest throughout our community and program. We were able to have alumni around the country listen to our football games anytime. Our experience with Al and Mark was terrific. For a school looking to broadcast their games, contact AM Sports."<br /> Tim Salter - Upland HS/Head Football Coach</p>
